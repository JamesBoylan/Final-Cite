    <h1>
      COMPILATION CITE
    </h1>
    <p>
      Over the past two weeks in our Web Design Vapa class, we made a couple of webcites. Many had to do with the corona virus, and things we are doing with it, one was not. This webiste is dedicated to linking to all of those other websites and compiling them here. I did not learn too much off of what I already knew but I became better at coding HTML and CSS and making my websites look better. I did learn though how to use VSCode and Github much more effienty which is very nice and helpful
